## **2.** Technical report

### *Preprocessing*

bla bla bla 

### *Candidate algorithms and hyperparameters*

#### **-** Random forest classifier:
We chose this classifier since it is supposed to be good with unbalanced data, which is the case with our dataset.
#### **-** MLPClassifier: 

#### **-** SVM:
We chose this learning algorithm since it is good at analyzing data for classification and regression analysis. This is also an algorithm that is known from our lectures.
